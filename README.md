## Description:
> fitLink is a social application that helps users find outdoor fitness activities with others. During this pandemic most individuals have found themselves locked indoors and possibly becoming more anti-social than one would prefer, fitLink gets you outdoors and allows you to be apart of a community. When you access our application, you have the ability to sign up or log in and then can view different outdoor activities and events. As a member, you can also create an event for others to attend.
